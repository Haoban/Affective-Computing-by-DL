    "## Task 4 (Bonus Task). Emotion Speech Recognition using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "**This exercise task asks you to conduct deep learning based emotion speech recognition using the given model architecture on the given data**.\n",
    "Generally speaking, you are asked to predict the emotion of the speaker based on given speech waveforms with arbitrary lengths. \n",
    "In this task, you need to use the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) which we have used in the bonus task of Exercise 1, but with 1-dimension filers. \n",
    "Besides, you also need to use a sequential data analysis deep learning module, the [Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)](https://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/). \n",
    "The 1-d CNN here is used to extract locally short time feature from speech frames, \n",
    "and the LSTM is used to synthesize the globally long-term feature based on these short time features. \n",
    "The network architecture will be end-to-end, which receives the sequence of waveform frames as the inputs and directly give the prediction of the emotion. As a result, the philosophy of 'short time analysis' is still applied here and you need to make the speech waveform as a sequence of equal-length waveform frames and feed them to the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this part, the dataset to be used is a subset of [*Toronto emotional speech set (TESS)*](https://tspace.library.utoronto.ca/handle/1807/24487). The TESS dataset contains the utterance which are spoken under 7 categories of emotions by two actresses (young actress and old actress). In this exercise, we select two categories of data (happy and sad) which is generated by young speakers. In total there are 400 samples (200 samples for each class). The **training and evaluation protocol will be that 70% of the data will be selected as the training data, and the rest will be the test data**. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to the bonus task of the exercise 1, we have provided the code which defines the network architecture using pytorch, and you will need to invoke it in your training and evaluation code. You are also encouraged to implement your own network, and all software framework are accepted. The network architecture is described in the figure below.\n",

    "\n",
    "We provide following procedures to support you to complete this exercise. But you are free to achieve the exercise goal by your own way of implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Load and normalize the speech data by subtract the mean and divide the stand variance which are calculated from the whole dataset. To load the speech data, you can use the [librosa.load()](https://librosa.github.io/librosa/generated/librosa.core.load.html#librosa-core-load) for example, and you can also use other tools if you like.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Segment frames from the speech waveforms in order to perform short-time analysis. For example you can make your window size as 20-40 ms, with or without overlapping.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Split the dataset to training set and testing set, the testing set will be 30% of the whole dataset.\n",
